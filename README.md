### Hola, 

My name is Jasmine, I prefer Jas. I'm a fresh Software Engineer with no prior experience in tech, but I love numbers. Previously I was a Logistical manager in the U.S Army for five years. That was my eye opener into the world.


- I love traveling and learning new cultures
- I'm an certified advance Esthetician 
- Roadtrips is a must 
- I love to hike 
- Ask me about my time transition into the world 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I once went on a 18 hour road trip because the scenery was so pretty
